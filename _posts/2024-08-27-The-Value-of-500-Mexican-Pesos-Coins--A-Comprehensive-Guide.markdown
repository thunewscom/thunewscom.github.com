The 500 pesos coin has a rich history tied to Mexico's economic landscape. Introduced during the late 1980s and early 1990s, this coin was minted from base metals like copper and nickel. The historical backdrop of its creation is crucial for understanding its current value. The introduction of this coin coincided with significant economic changes in Mexico, including inflation and shifts in currency policy. The 1993 devaluation of the peso, which saw three zeros stripped from the currency, marked a pivotal moment in the coin's journey. This reform altered the monetary system dramatically, impacting the value of older coins like the 500 pesos coin, which now represents a fraction of its original worth. 
### Devaluation and the Introduction of the Nuevo Peso
In 1993, Mexico faced a severe economic crisis, leading the government to implement a currency reform. This reform introduced the nuevo peso (MXN), which effectively replaced the old peso (MXP) by eliminating three zeros from the currency. Thus, 1 nuevo peso became equivalent to 1,000 old pesos. This transition was essential for stabilizing the economy and restoring public confidence in the currency. The implications for the 500 pesos coin were significant; a coin minted in 1988 now holds a value of only 0.5 nuevo pesos. This section will delve deeper into the economic circumstances that necessitated such drastic measures, including inflation rates, government policies, and public sentiment that led to this pivotal reformation in currency. Understanding this context is vital for grasping the historical significance of the 500 pesos coin.
